## TODO
 - Electoral data for the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, and all Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019 must be appended to their respective results datasets.
 - Parliament and assembly delimitation relationships must be found and parsed for delimitations in 1973, 1962, and 1952, and appended to their appropriate datasets. 
 - Results need to be rewritten after delimitation so that result datasets have parliamentary or assembly IDs
 - Gujarat 2012 and Arunachal Pradesh 2014 assembly elections need to be recorded and parsed, since their source PDFs are just images. 
 - Himachal Pradesh 1977 elections need to be rescanned and parsed
