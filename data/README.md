The source data and its processing is split into several directories, where the workflow is srcdata -> prep -> writers -> datasets. These directories contain, in short:

- datasets: The processed and formatted data, formatted to be used in a relational database.
- writers: The scripts to take prepared source data and format it correctly to be a dataset.
- prep: The scripts and tools to get or refine all source data into a format that can be written to a dataset.
- srcdata: The original data pulled from.
